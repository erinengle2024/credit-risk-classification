# credit-risk-classification


Welcome to my submission for the Leaflet Challenge in module 20 of the Data Analytics bootcamp. This project was completed as part of the curriculum to showcase my proficiency in Unsupervised Machine Learning using libraries such as SciKit-learn and Hvplot.


# Challenge Description
For this assignment, we used unsupervised learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency price changes over 24 hours and 7 days. We normalized the data, applied K-means clustering, and used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the data dimensions and compared the clustering results before and after PCA to evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering performance.

  # My Results



# Resources Used

Challenges I drew heavily from include the following:
 - The Everyone Elbow Method Activity
 - The Finding K Activity
 - The Complex Data Activity
 - The Segmenting with PCA Activity
 - The Stocks Activity




These challenges, in addition to the other challenges provided, helped teach us the following:
- How to instantiate, fit, and use Kmeans models
- How to normalize data using standard scaler
- Perform principle component analysis
- Implement the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k)
- Visualize clustering results with scatter plots using hvPlot
 






 ## Additional Resources
For syntax that I was not familiar with, I used resources such as the Xpert Learning Assistant, provided by UC Berkely Bootcamp, Scikit-Learn & Composite Documentation, W3 Schools, and ChatGPT.
